# Roped-As-One
The source code for the game I made for the 2021 GMTK game jam.

It's a jam game, so it's obviously quite messy in the code and I wouldn't recomend building upon it. Things are done in very unconventional ways!

# Where-to-Play
You can play my game for free at https://ketamic.itch.io/roped-as-one, if you are interested.
